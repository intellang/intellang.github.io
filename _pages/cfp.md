title: Call for papers
---

The workshop is intended as a lively, open event to generate discussion. We would welcome submissions that are not only technical papers, but also position and discussion papers (highlights, as defined in the CFP of the main conference), about the intersection of NLG and Intelligent Data and Information processing. In addition, we will include an invited speaker talk and some discussion so new synergies and topics could arise.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, tareas related to the use of AI techniques for:

- Knowledge representation models for NLG.
- Uncertainty management in NLG problems.
- Algorithms for data analysis in the NLG process.
- Quality models to guide the development of tools and techniques and for the evaluation of proposals.
- Computational Creativity.
- Explainable Artificial Intelligence.
- Data-to-text NLG
- Text-to-Text Generation
- Dialog systems
- Text Summarization
- Generation of text grounded in multimodal data
- Modular versus end-to-end NLG systems


## Submitting to the workshop

We invite paper submissions that consist not only of technical papers, but also position and discussion papers.

- Regular papers on substantial, original and unpublished research, including technical descriptions of working systems and prototypes (up to 7 pages, not including references).

- Position papers highlighting discussion issues, opinion pieces, etc. (up to 4 pages, not including references).

The venue of the workshop and related travel information can also be found on the main conference website.
